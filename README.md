### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm BÃ¼ÅŸra

I am a Computer Engineer.

ðŸ’» Throughout my academic journey, I focused particularly on the Java language, developing projects based on object-oriented programming (OOP), layered architecture, and SOLID principles, thereby establishing a strong foundation in this field.

ðŸ“¡ I am currently working on network technologies, deepening my knowledge in this field by combining the theoretical knowledge I have acquired with practical applications.
