### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm BÃ¼ÅŸra

I am a graduate of Ondokuz MayÄ±s University, Department of Computer Engineering. As a computer engineer who is open to development and learning, my greatest motivation is to bring the teamwork and problem-solving skills I have gained through the projects I participated in during my university years into my professional career, contribute value to the organization I work for, develop innovative solutions, and build a successful career.
